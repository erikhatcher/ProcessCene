# ProcessCene

Inspired by [Story of Search](https://storyofsearch.com/) and impressive Processing work that my colleague John Page does at MongoDB.

## TODO
  * Offline mode - run once online and capture all the data statically so it needs no connections to run
  * Move all online/live operations to Slide constructors
  * on AllyzersSlide - have it generate all tokens for all analyzers in constructor so the entire slide data is part of total number of steps, rather than just one analzyer
